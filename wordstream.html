						<h4>PPC - Achieve More Efficient Pay-Per Click (PPC) Marketing</h4>
						<p><strong>PPC</strong> (<a href="#">pay-per click</a>) search marketing software offers a means for accomplishing two core requirements for PPC optimization:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>PPC Automation</strong> - While it would be impossible (and inadvisable!) to automate every aspect of <a href="#">pay-per-click advertising</a>, automating away redundant, time-consuming tasks affords you a means of increasing productivity. Often, this means being able to produce an amount of work that would otherwise have been unachievable for you and your business.</li>
							<li><strong>PPC Management</strong> - <a href="#">PPC management</a> refers to the maintenance and prioritization of <a href="#">paid search</a> marketing tasks.
